My preferences for bash setup

I'm kinda sick of having to add these in every time I'm on a new node or server.  Hopefully I can just
just centralize this and bring it in whenever I have to spend more than a few minutes logged
in to any account.

But this repo could be more. This is an excellent model with which to study branches and 
forked development.

Derived from this "master base" branch, could be a "MacOS" branch, a "windows bash" branch, 
and a traditional Linux bash branch. Maybe for fun, there could be a Cygwin branch, and more!
